// ue_wrap/actors/garbage_bag.h -- the bagging family: the two tools a player packs a trash pile
// with, and the filled bag the pack produces.
//
// Its own file rather than a corner of ue_wrap/actors/prop: bagging is one feature, and prop.cpp
// is at the size where the next feature to land in it would be looking for a home anyway.
//
// A folded bag (prop_garbBagFold_C) is spent whole on one pack; a roll (prop_garbBagRoll_C) holds
// a count in `bags` and is spent one at a time; both spawn prop_garbageBag_C at the target's
// transform with the target's chipType. The gameplay lane that carries a client's pack across is
// coop/props/pack_trash_intent.
