// ue_wrap/hotbar/icons.h -- the quick-slot bar and the two tables its icons are drawn from.
//
// `ui_UI_C::updateSlotInv` rebuilds the bar whole: it lists the player container's records,
// clears every slot image's material to the engine's black placeholder, then writes each icon
// from `lib_C::propToIcon`, which indexes a texture array on the game instance by a name table
// on `ApropProcessor_C`. The renderer publishes that pair seconds after the world is up, and
// the game's own post-load refresh runs first -- so the lookups return null and the black
// stands. docs/ui.md has the mechanism and what the mod adds.
//
// This file is the wrapper half: read the bar's inputs, read what a slot is showing, and
// re-issue the game's verb. Which world is owed a rebuild, and when, is a policy and lives in
// coop/items/hotbar_icon_edge.h.
//
// Engine-wrapper layer (principle 7): reflection and thunks only, no gameplay policy, no
// network and no coop state. Game thread.
