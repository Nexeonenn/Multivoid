// coop/items/hotbar_icon_edge.h -- rebuild the quick-slot bar once per world, when the icons it
// needs arrive after the game has already drawn it without them.
//
// The game publishes its prop-icon tables seconds after a world load and refreshes the bar before
// that, so every icon resolves to nothing and the slots keep the placeholder black; at the moment
// it publishes, the renderer refreshes the equipment panel and tells the bar nothing. This is the
// notification it never sends. docs/ui.md has the mechanism, the measurement, and why the
// trigger asks whether the bar is wrong rather than watching the tables fill.
//
// The reading and the verb are the wrapper's (ue_wrap/hotbar/icons.h); the policy -- which world
// is owed a rebuild, and when it stops asking -- is here. No network and no coop state: a host, a
// client and a world with no session at all lose the same race for the same reason.
