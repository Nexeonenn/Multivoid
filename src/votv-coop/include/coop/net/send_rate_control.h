// coop/net/send_rate_control.h -- what a peer's link actually does, measured per slot.
//
// The transport offers no bandwidth estimate: it writes a connection's send rate once at connect
// from the ping and thereafter only clamps it, so a link past a few milliseconds of ping runs at
// the configured floor for its whole life. This module measures what replaces it -- the goodput
// the peer acknowledges, and a round trip timed on the lane the pose stream rides -- and DECIDES
// the rate from it; the session writes that rate to the connection. A busy link reports once a
// second, an idle one is probed slowly and silently, because a baseline taken only under load is
// the queue it is meant to reveal. This is the ONLY writer of a send rate: `net.ratecontrol=0`
// leaves the transport at its stock rate and `net.sendrate_kbs` pins a fixed one, and neither is a
// fallback, because the behaviour they restore was the defect. The law, the two refuted before it
// and the measurements that separate them are in docs/send-path.md.
//
// Threading: three byte counters are atomics written at the send and receive choke points from
// whichever thread reached them, and a fourth ARMS a slot's teardown. The rest is net-thread-only.
