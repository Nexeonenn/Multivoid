// coop/net/send_admission.h -- who may put reliable bytes into a connection's send buffer.
//
// The transport admits a message only while a connection's pending bytes plus that message fit the
// send buffer, and that sum is connection-wide: a bulk stream at the brim refuses the unreliable
// pose and voice datagrams beside it, and the probe that times the path they ride. This rule bounds
// OURS -- every reliable send but the probe pair and the join beacon stops short of a reserve --
// and a SECOND bound, in TIME, holds the unqueued path to a budget of this link's own measured
// delivery, because bytes inside the transport can be neither retracted nor reordered. Neither
// guarantees room: a NACKed segment is re-queued into pending with no admission check, so on a
// lossy link it passes the buffer size from outside while we add nothing. A send this rule refuses
// is never lost -- it goes to the backlog, or it is the save pump's pacing signal.
//
// The occupancy compared is an estimate, re-anchored on the transport's own pending total at each
// link sample: high when a drain went unseen, which is the safe direction, and low by a bounded
// amount, both corrected at the next anchor. Both bounds' measurements are in docs/send-path.md.
