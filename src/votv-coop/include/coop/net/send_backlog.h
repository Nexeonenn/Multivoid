// coop/net/send_backlog.h -- the reliable-send delivery guarantee.
//
// GNS "reliable" is ARQ only for messages that ENTER the stream. With the per-connection
// send buffer full, SendMessages refuses at enqueue (-k_EResultLimitExceeded) and, under
// bDeleteFailedMessages, deletes the message. Some sixty call sites used to ignore that
// false return, which is how a join could silently lose hundreds of prop spawns and leave
// containers permanently empty on the joiner.
//
// THE INVARIANT: a reliable send either enters the stream, enters this backlog, or the
// connection dies. Never warn-and-drop. The guarantee's scope is the connection's lifetime;
// FreeSlot at teardown discards the dead peer's backlog, its state dying with it (the MTA
// CNetServerBuffer precedent). Each slot's backlog is stamped with the hConn it opened
// under, and the drain discards the whole thing when the slot's live hConn no longer
// matches: slots recycle lowest-free with no observable absence, and person Y must never
// receive person X's queued state.
