// coop/session/join_beacon.h -- the host's half of the join's progress: once a second, per joining
// slot, what this host is doing for that joiner and how far in. The client's half is
// coop/session/join_progress.h, which waits on this token instead of on a wall clock.
//
// The contract is silence. An owner calls NotePhase every pass it works on a slot; Tick sends at
// most one note per slot per second and sends NOTHING for a slot nobody noted. So a host that
// stopped working on a joiner stops beaconing by construction, with no separate "I gave up"
// message to remember to send -- and a joiner whose token expires names the phase and the side
// that stopped. The deferred snapshot is noted the same way while it waits, which is the one
// host-side state whose silence no other message covered.
//
// Host only (Tick no-ops on a client), game thread only: the three owners all run inside the net
// pump's tick. No engine calls.
