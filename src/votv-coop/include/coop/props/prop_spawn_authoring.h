// coop/props/prop_spawn_authoring.h -- did a PLAYER author this prop birth, or did the game?
//
// A client's world mints keyed props constantly with nobody asking: spawners, a dirthole, a
// lightning strike, an impact, lib_C::replaceProp. Each resolves the same catalog and finishes the
// same GameplayStatics spawn the sandbox spawn menu does, and none may cross -- every peer's game
// makes its own, so an intent per birth would double the world. So the drop-intent lane cannot
// admit by CLASS; the discriminator is WHO ASKED. Background:
// docs/coop-entity-expression-map.md, "Who asked, for a client's fresh birth".

// The two player spawn verbs, read from bytecode on the shipped pak. The MENU: a catalog click
// runs ui_spawnmenu_C::spawn, which calls gamemode->spawnPropThroughGamemode -- a verb replaceProp
// and the impact component call too, so it is identified by its CALLER, through a script-body gate
// watch. The TOOLGUN: tool_spawn_C::init enters ExecuteUbergraph_tool_spawn, which finishes its
// own spawns and holds no other FinishSpawningActor, so the native seam's caller frame names it.

// Gameplay layer (principle 7): reaches the engine only through ue_wrap. Game thread only -- the
// gate and the native seam both hand their callbacks the VM's live frame.

// never asks the question: its own births are the shared world whoever asked for them. Idempotent

// call every subsystem-install tick. Game thread.

// bracket, both of which mean nothing outside one. False when neither verb is on the stack, which
// is every ambient spawn the world makes for itself. Game thread.
