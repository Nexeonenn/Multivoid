// means the rebuild found no icons rather than that the bar is short.

// This asks about the OUTCOME rather than watching the tables go from empty to full, because the
// transition is not reliably observable: a world load runs as one long blocking call, and a run
// was measured in which the tables filled between the game's own refresh and this reader's first
