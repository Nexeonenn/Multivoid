// coop/net/connection_tuning.h -- the transport parameters a seated connection runs under.
//
// One concept: everything the transport is TOLD about a connection once it is ours, as opposed to
// what the connection then does (session_status.cpp owns the slot's life) or what we send over it.
// Three parameters live here, and they are one concept because they are written at one moment, to
// one connection, through one API, and each is meaningless without the others: the priority lanes
// the reliable kinds ride, the send buffer those lanes share, and the rate the whole connection is
// paced at.
//
// It was extracted from session_status.cpp when that file crossed the 800-line soft cap, and the
// function it came from was called ConfigureLanesForPeer while also setting the buffer and the
// rate -- a name that had stopped describing its own body.

// `rateControlled` is the session's own resolved answer, passed in rather than re-read here. The
// ini is resolved live on every read, so a flag flipped after Session::Start would otherwise give
// the one combination that is wrong in both directions: this function writing an opening rung that
// the controller -- disabled at Start -- will never move again.
// `pinnedRateKbs` is the drill's fixed-rate override, 0 for none. It is PASSED rather than
// resolved here because the session already resolved it once, at Start, to decide whether the
// controller runs at all -- and `ResolveInt` re-reads the ini on every call. Resolving it a second
// time per connection let an ini edited mid-session pin one connection while the controller was
// still steering it: two writers of one rate, out of one knob read twice.
